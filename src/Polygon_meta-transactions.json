It means we have to get rid of msg.sender and msg.value properties in our code.\nLink ->\nhttps://docs.biconomy.io/tutorials/native-meta-transactions/enable-native-meta-transactions/smart-contract\n\nLooking further into the Matic documentation, I found link to the Proof-fo-Stake contracts:\n\nsource ->\nhttps://github.com/maticnetwork/pos-portal/tree/v1.0.0/contracts/child/ChildToken\n\nFinally, I discovered, according to my understanding, that Matic integrates only deposit() and withdraw() functions with Biconomy. Does it mean that Biconomy woud never work with ERC-20 functionalities like approve(), allowance(), transfer()? Do you have plans to implement Biconomy functionalities for the Proof-fo-Stake? contracts?\n\nOur team highly appreciate your support. We're eager to get through all the concerns we have, and proudly make the release on Matic. I'm always glad to add more or clarify the details.",

We've improved it little bit, which is in deployment queue. As soon as it gets clearance, we'll deploy it, and will let you know here. You can simply send HTTP GET request to that end point & obtain json response.",

The current txn costs are still very cheap at $0.00006 on average. \nIf Matic was to get as popular as Ethereum - which does 1.15M txns in a day and our coin would go 10X from today - the daily cost of all of those txns would still be ~$690.\nThat being said, our tech is horizontally scalable and if txn cost starts to become an impediment, we can spawn chains horizontally and keep the txn costs low",

We will wait to see how the ecosystem evolved and the community reaction on the transaction costs and then take a call. \nWe don't want to try to find ways to stabilise the Matic token. We feel that its price should be completely market driven. For value exchange, most use stablecoins like USDC.\n\nI had a quick question, how long into the future are you modelling your costs ?\nWhen you say that every penny counts, can you please share what would be the impact, if the price of Matic eg. increases by 10% \nWe can discuss this on DM's as well",

Yesterday I bought about $1K worth of Matic/usd with the intention of staking it using Unifarm via Metamask.\n\nI followed steps from an article how to add the Matic Mainnet into Metamask using a new Custom RPC. After I did that I copied my metamask address and sent the coins to that from my Binance.us account. (transaction fee of 38 matic!). At this time it's been over 15 hours since I initiated the transfer and I still do not see it in my Metamask or on my address details on the maticvigil.com website. What can I do and what did I do wrong here? Thanks!\n\nhttps://etherscan.io/tx/0xcaf4b6cfb1a3647b8cdaa637d360e6ce86b60085dca6502331e82696bfa6563e",

      "content": "Hi. I transferred some 1inch from erc20 to matic and they show up in metamask however nothing on matic recognises them so I think I've made an error along the way. I have the 1inch token, with horse head showing but the 1inch I sent is showing as something different. Any ideas on what I need to do? I assume send the false 1inch tokens back via bridge to Erc20? When I go to the matic bridge the 1inch are showing. I tried Quickswap but it doesn't see the 1inch. This is very puzzling.",
